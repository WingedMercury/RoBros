This website is for the Lexington High Schools roboticis club.
We used white and red because it is the schools colors.
We used black as most of the text color instead of red because red is on the low side of the spectrum and is hard to read.
We used sans-serif fonts because the font is readable when reduced in resolution or reduced in font size and is readable from far away.
We used green and #ddffdd to get your attention.
We used different shades of grey for the calendar.
